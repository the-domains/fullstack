# Convergence: Understanding and Aligning Orchestration, Automation, NFV and SDN

> In SDN paradigms, network virtualization tends to be accomplished using overlays like Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), Network Virtualization using GRE (NVGRE) and Stateless Transport Tunneling (STT), possibly in conjunction with OpenFlow. In an overlay network, traffic that is part of a particular virtual network has an identifying wrapper placed around it that isolates it from other virtual networks sharing the same underlying physical network. While not strictly required, an SDN controller can be used to identify all of a virtual network's endpoints, instructing switches where and how to encapsulate traffic inside of the overlay, maximizing the efficiency of endpoint-to-endpoint communication.
