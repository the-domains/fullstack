New Year, New Challenges.  null

It's time to start working smarter, not harder.  Automation is our friend.  When things are repeatable, they can be secured, by utilizing the right amount of monitoring, alerting, automation, and diligence.  I posit, that by 2025, Software Defined D̶a̶t̶a̶ ̶C̶e̶n̶t̶e̶r̶ _ANYTHING_ (SDx) Automation Security will be the predominant career choice for many future information security professionals.  I've just started the new year out with new associations to work with, ONUG, and the Opencompute-Networking workgroups.  I'm excited to see what becomes of all of the efforts toward creating a truly open standard for interoperability between vendors, products, and software solutions.  I believe the following are going to the be the mantra's of companies moving forward: 

1\. If it's not automated, it's broken

2\. If you have to manually intervene, it's not production ready

3\. If it doesn't fail-over/scale/recover/self-heal without someone being called, it's broken
